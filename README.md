# InternHacks Team 8 FitMood Repo

Hi team - here are the files so far for the fitmood website <br><br>
Yes, you've heard it right - **we're scratching Electron off our list for now and migrating fitmood files to a website** - not feasible at this time considering our team timeframe <br><br>
Right now, I'm working with my local server to test our website features - specifically the login system. <br><br>
To work with these files please download XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
<br>
Once you get XAMPP downloaded if you want to preview your website running on the server make sure use localhost//(insert project folder name here) - for me it is localhost/fitmood <br><br>
What I did so far was to create a dummy mysql database in the phpmyadmin panel <br><br>

# Update: USE fitmoodv2 AS CURRENT REPO FOR FITMOOD PROJECT
I had to make some changes to make the login work / only had the insert data part of the system working but not the login
